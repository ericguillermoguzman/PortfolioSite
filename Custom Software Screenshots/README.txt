The files here are screenshots of proprietary, custom desktop applications I wrote.

I cannot show the code.

The two programs I can show are 

1) An e-com listing software that calls multiple API's in order to transfer products between independent e-com platforms (similar to copying a listing from Amazon to Ebay).

2) A data analysis software that digitally restructures and identifies thousands of products as they are being counted physically. This software efficiently aids in inventory counts done between private, retail, and Federal Databases.

Screenshots show effective use cases and error cases.
